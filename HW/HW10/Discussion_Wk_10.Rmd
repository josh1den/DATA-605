The $ij$th entry $p^{(n)}_{ij}$ of the matrix $P^n$ gives the probabilty that the Markov chain, starting in state $s_i$ will be in state $s_j$ after $n$ steps.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(expm)
labels <- c("H","Y","D")
T_mat <- matrix(c(0.8,0.2,0.0, # transition matrix
                  0.3,0.4,0.3,
                  0.2,0.1,0.7),
                nrow=3,
                byrow=TRUE,
                dimnames=list(labels,labels))
T_mat
T_mat %*% T_mat
T_mat %^% 2
```

Grandson = 2nd step. The probability is 0.7.
