### Mulitple Regression from WHO data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josh1den/DATA-605/main/HW/HW12/who.csv"
df = read.csv(url)
head(df)
```

```{r}
names(df)
```

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x=TotExp, y=LifeExp)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Total Expenditures vs. Life Expectancy", x="Total Expenditures", y="Life Expectancy")
```

```{r}
df.lm1 = lm(LifeExp ~ TotExp, df)
summary(df.lm1)
```

The **F-statistic** compares variable fits in multiple regression models. Since this is a single-intercept model, the f-statistic is not meaningful.

The **R-squared** of 0.25 indicates Total Expenditures accounts for only 25% of the variance in Life Expectancy. This is very low.

The **Standard Error** of 7.535e-01 for the intercept and 7.795e-06 for the slope are small relative to the coefficients, which suggests low variability among the parameters.

The **P-value** of 7.71e-14 is very small and significant. This means there is a high probability total expenditures is relevant to life expectancy.

The takeaway is total expenditures is relevant life expectancy, but doesn't fully explain it. More is needed.

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x=TotExp^0.06, y=LifeExp^4.6)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Total Expenditures vs. Life Expectancy", x="Total Expenditures ^0.06", y="Life Expectancy ^4.6")
```
```{r}
df.lm2 = lm(I(LifeExp^4.6) ~ I(TotExp^0.06), df)
summary(df.lm2)
```
The **F-statistic** is still comparing a single linear model, so it is not relevant.

The **R-squared** of 0.73 indicates Total Expenditures accounts for only 73% of the variance in Life Expectancy, which is much stronger than the previous model.

The **Standard Error** of 46817945 for the intercept and 27518940 for the slope are very large relative to the coefficients, which indicates the model is not estimating them well.

The **P-value** of 2.2e-16 is very small, in line with the previous model which indicates total expenditures is relevant to life expectancy.

The takeaway is that this model better explains the variance between the variables, but because the standard is larger, does not accurately predict them.

Given the equation $ùëå = mx + b$ where $m$ is the slope, $b$ is the intercept, and $x, Y$ are points on the line:

```{r}
x1 = 1.5 
x2 = 2.5  
b = df.lm2$coefficients[1] #intercept
m = df.lm2$coefficients[2] #slope

pred_1 = m*x1 + b
pred_2 = m*x2 + b

inv_1 = round(pred_1^(1/4.6),2) #inverted prediction
inv_2 = round(pred_2^(1/4.6),2)

print(paste("When TotExp^.06=1.5, Life Expectancy is",inv_1))
print(paste("When TotExp^.06=2.5, Life Expectancy is",inv_2))
```

```{r}
df.lm3 = lm(LifeExp ~ PropMD + TotExp + PropMD*TotExp, df)
summary(df.lm3)
```
The **F-statistic** is very similar to the R-squared value, which suggests removing a variable will have a negligable affect to the model's reliability.

The **R-squared** of 0.35 is low, indicating the combined variables account for 35% of the variability of life expectancy.

The **Standard Error** for the intercept, total expenditures, and proportion of doctors to total expenditures is very low, indicating low variability, while proportion of doctors has high variability. 

The **P-value**s are all low, indicating the variables are all significant.

Takeaway - this model does not model the data as well as the previous model, however neither model is reliable at prediction.

```{r}
b0 = df.lm3$coefficients[1]
b1 = df.lm3$coefficients[2]
b2 = df.lm3$coefficients[3]
b3 = df.lm3$coefficients[4]

pred = b0 + .03*b1 + 14*b2 + .03*14*b3
print(pred)
```

It does not seem realistic that increasing the percent of doctors can lead to a life expectancy of nearly 108 years!
