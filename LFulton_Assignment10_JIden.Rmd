This is a [Gambler's Ruin](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-gamblers-ruin-problem-9c97a7747171) problem, where $q_k$ is the probability that the gambler's stake reaches $0$ before it reaches $M$, given the initial stake $k$, with any $z$ with $1 \leq z \leq M$:

$q_k = \frac{(\frac{q}{p})^z - 1}{(\frac{q}{p})^M - 1}$

a)  The probability of betting \$1 each time:

```{r}
M = 8 #desired total
z = 1 # initial stake
p = 0.4 # probability of winning
q = 1-p # probability of losing

qk = (1 - (q/p)^z) / (1 - (q/p)^M)
qk
```

b)  Probability of betting as much as possible to bring his fortune up to \$8:

To bet as much as possible, then $z_0 = 1, z_1 = 2, z_2 = 4, z_3 = 8$, and calculating the probabilty $p$ that the player wins $z$ straight times:

```{r}
z = 3 # no. of times
p^z
```

c)  Which strategy gives the better chance of getting out of jail?

Betting the farm each time!
